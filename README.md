# Hey üëã I'm Martin
I'm a Software Engineer at **Nanatec Limited**, where I build **highly scalable software** that perfectly matches business needs. My approach focuses on strong fundamentals and practical business solutions, using modern **microservices** and **event-driven architectures** to create systems that are robust and adaptable.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Toolkit

I build software using technologies that empower scalable and reliable solutions:

* **Node.js & TypeScript:** Server-side JavaScript/TypeScript runtime for robust backend development.
* **Deno:** Secure, modern JS/TS runtime with built-in tooling.
* **NATS:** High-performance messaging for inter-service communication (pub/sub, req/rep).
* **gRPC:** High-performance RPC framework for efficient microservice communication.
* **Express.js:** Minimalist Node.js web framework for building APIs.
* **Medusa.js:** Headless e-commerce platform for customizable backends.
* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Secure token-based authentication and authorization.
* **Docker:** Containerization platform for consistent and isolated environments.
* **MongoDB:** Flexible, NoSQL document database for scalability.
* **PostgreSQL:** Robust relational database known for reliability and features.
* **Microservices Architecture:** Loosely coupled services for agility and resilience.
* **Event-Driven Systems:** Asynchronous communication via events for scalability and reactivity.

I also have deep interests in **robotics** and **blockchain** technologies.
